In this repo we are modelling a game of battleships.

Ship class
----------------------------
-We need the ships to initialize with a certain size.
-We need this class to respond to getting shot

----------------------------
Board class
----------------------------
-We need the board to initialize with a certain size
-We need to place a ship within the board
-we need to be able to attack the ships
-we need a way to log and view all attacks made
-we need a way to check if a certain space has a boat inside it (this will be used privately in various other methods)
